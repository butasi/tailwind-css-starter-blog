> # Introduction

<p>
  {' '}
  To explain how I got into `Linux` it is only fair that we go back to the very beginning of this journey.
  Back then I had always been fascinated with hacking and the cool mambo jambo that went on there. I
  cannot remember at what age exactly but it was always there at the back of my mind. Needless to say
  I was elbows deep in all electronics I could get my hands on. This, minus the times shit went side
  ways and I had to explain what I was doing inside the new radio is partially why I got into IT.
</p>
<p>
  Flash forward to during my Diploma course. I was at the computer lab with my fresh install of
  Windows 10 ready to fill it up with the usual junk. There was this guy there with his tiny laptop
  hammering at his keyboard profusely. "He must be one of those." In my snickering I decided to
  glance at whatever this guy was doing. It is said when you have a passion,a desire for something,
  it is really the passion that has you. I stared into the abyss and it stared back. Here, I was
  caught by the love for the terminal.
</p>
<p>
  At the time I had only interacted with cmd and armed myself with some diskpart commands. I was
  pretty good, or atleast thats what I thought then. Yet here was a guy doing what ever unbelievable
  stuff this is. It had already been decided. I had to know whatever this 'godlike' power was. He
  might have been running a simple `apt-update` but to this bewildered young man , this was
  something extra ordinary.
</p>
<p>
  {' '}
  Into the rabbit hole I started. In and Out like in Kamiti, I thought. Well many years later it still
  feels like I am just touching the tip of the ice berg. Still after all this journey to oblivion do
  I seem to glance at the beginning of eternity First came Kali Linux, which is still the buggiest I
  have ever had to use,or maybe my it was just my install. There was a time I had to go for a weekafter
  wrecking my systems. I wanted to dual boot Kali with Windows yet my grub skills were non existent.
  Eventually figured it out. I remember my first successful installation, the dragon unveiling itself
  on my screen and I just sat there and wondered `what next` and it was back to searching how to install
  vlc.
</p>
<p>
  Then came Parrot OS still based on debian. At the time, it seemed easier and more natural. I guess
  I had already gone through the hardships of setting up kali Linux and getting it usable. This was
  when I discovered there was actually Desktop Environments and Window Manager. Before I had always
  been on gnome and ever since I switched from it I never tried it again Then came KDE and I was
  like, now this is Linux. When I found plasma, I didn't know what it was but I knew it would
  replace gnome if I installed it on my system. So I purged gnome, just literally reaping out apps I
  knew were gnomey(yeah I'll use that) and installed plasma. At the end I had broken dependancies a
  slow and buggy system but some how withinthe mismatched window titlesand colors it had worked.
  Within the shocked sytem state, I could see the difference. I think neofetch is what narrowed me
  down and I ended up discovering a whole new field It was as though I had been operating in this
  folder and now I could `cd ..` into a previous folder with even more stuff
</p>
<p>
  {' '}
  Me and mine moved over to KDE on Parrot OS. Easier said than done; This was after countless other distros.
  Now that I had the knowledge and the know how on how to get and boot different disros, it was only
  fair that I try out afew. Maybe one or two. It was a lot. It wasnt one or two and I dare say I wenton
  a frenzy with it. Still, after countless other tries Somehow still I found out about tiling from the
  settings in KDE. I was able to add a tiling manager to my KDE installation. This was still on Parrot
  OS.

By this time I already knew of Arch Linux. But 'read the archwiki' comments werent doing me any good
