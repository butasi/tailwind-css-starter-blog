Awesome Tools tools I have come across. Installation procedures are for arch linux
with `yay` as the Arch User Repository Manager. Users of other distributions should
find equivalent commands for their systems.

`Neofetch`

> Neofetch is a system information tool for many systems running the Bash shell.
> On the left side is always a logo of the distribution, rendered in ASCII art.
> There is no refresh like the ability of a system monitor because the intended purpose are screenshots.

To install run

```
sudo pacman -S neofetch
```

`Bpytop`

> BpyTop is an open-source command-line application allowing linux users to monitor their system resources like memory, CPU,
> and network information. It displays all the required information right onto your terminal.
> It works similar to HTop and Top but has a more advanced interface than them.

```
yay -S bpytop
```

`tldr`

> Command line client for tldr, a collection of simplified and community-driven man pages.

```
sudo pacman -S tldr
```
