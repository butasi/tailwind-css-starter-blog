> # `Overview`

Awesome Tools tools I have come across. Installation procedures are for arch linux
with `yay` as the Arch User Repository Manager. Users of other distributions should
find equivalent commands for their systems.

`Neofetch`

> Neofetch is a system information tool for many systems running the Bash shell.
> On the left side is always a logo of the distribution, rendered in ASCII art.
> There is no refresh like the ability of a system monitor because the intended purpose are screenshots.

To install run

```
sudo pacman -S neofetch
```

`Bpytop`

> BpyTop is an open-source command-line application allowing linux users to monitor their system resources like memory, CPU,
> and network information. It displays all the required information right onto your terminal.
> It works similar to HTop and Top but has a more advanced interface than them.

```
yay -S bpytop
```

`tldr`

> Command line client for tldr, a collection of simplified and community-driven man pages.

```
sudo pacman -S tldr
```

`Polly Grey`

```
Men don’t have the strategic intelligence to conduct a war between families.
Men are less good at keeping secrets out of their lies.
```

`Walter White`

```
Right now, what I need, is for you to climb down out of my *ss.
Can you do that? Will you do that for me, honey?
Will you please, just once, get off my *ss?
You know? I’d appreciate it. I really would.
```

```
What I came to realize is that fear, that’s the worst of it.
That’s the real enemy. So, get up, get out in the real world and
you kick that bastard as hard you can right in the teeth.
```

```
There is gold in the streets just waiting for someone to come and scoop it up.
